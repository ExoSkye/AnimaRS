- ### What standards are there?
	- There are seven levels of graphics standards in the [[Anima]] engine:
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G1]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G15]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G2]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G3]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G4]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/G5]]
		- [[Standards/Graphics/GX]]
-
- ### What do the names mean?
	- The graphics standards are named in ascending order of graphical quality. However [[Standards/Graphics/GX]] is special since it allows people making backends on powerful enough platforms (platforms that are able to do [[Standards/Graphics/G5]] easily) to go all out and make a graphics backend with the highest possible graphical fidelity.
